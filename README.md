# Repository for "Low-depth simulations of fermionic systems on square-grid quantum hardware"
This is an online repository for storing the original computations and circuits made for https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01862 .

The explicit circuits in a similar format to those present in the figures of the paper for the best cases in Table 1 can be found here, starting from the construction of the qubit layout, the edge, vertex and hopping operators. The circuits used for the rest of the paper are also displayed in the pdf of the original notes generated for this work.
